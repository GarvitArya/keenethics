# Hello World

Let me introduce Keenethics. We are a team of web and mobile developers located in Lviv, Ukraine (UTC+3). We do great job on a number of projects and participate in life of JavaScript community.

There are a lot of software development companies of different size and with wide range of rates out there. They have perks and competitive salaries for developers. They have experience, portfolio and good reviews from the clients. So, why did we decide to create another team indeed?

After analyzing several successful companies from the inside we have noticed their inefficiencies. Their attitude to a customer was not acceptable to us in many cases either. We believe thereâ€™s plenty of improvements we can bring to the industry to make software development more predictable, efficient and to make the result closer to customer expectations. We desire to make remote web development more keen and ethical.

Since we are devoted to Open Source, we are going to share our thoughts and experience on this subject in this blog. See you soon! :)
